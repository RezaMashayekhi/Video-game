# Video-game
A simple 2D action-adventure video game that we developed with GameMaker for our final project of Software Design course at AUT (2018).
We had to utilize Agile Method for making this game. This game was done in a team project, and I implemented the combat mechanics, NPCs
movements, etc., in GameMaker.
